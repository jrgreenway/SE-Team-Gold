class Player:
    ''' Player Class for the Avatar - could be renamed later
    
    Attributes:
    name: str
    position: tuple - current position on screen (x, y) or pygame Vector2 - TODO research
        which is best
    facing: str - direction the player is facing (N, S, E, W)
    speed: int / float - TODO decide on units
    sprite: pygame.image / bmp? - TODO need to research - the sprite for the player 
        TODO could be a list of sprites for the animations?
    TODO - discuss whether metrics should be a dict / separate class / independent 
        variables
    money: int / float
    happiness: int / float
    time: int / float

    Methods:
    constructor: __init__(self, name, position, facing, sprite, ...metrics) - TODO decide
        on optional parameters
    getters and setters for all attributes
    move: move(self, direction) - updates the position of the character in the given 
        direction (which is the new value of facing)
    updateMetrics: updateMetrics(self, metric, value) - TODO this approach would work best
        if metrics is an interface probably
    interact: interactObject(self, object) - uses the object's attributes to update the metrics
        of the player
    animate: animate(self, currentFrame, moving: Boolean) - updates the sprite of the player
        based on the current frame and whether the player is moving or not - called on every
        frame in the game logic
